## Train-Schedule Homework
### Assignment
In this assignment, we were tasked with creating a tool for a train scheduler. The tool would have to allow them to enter new trains into the Firebase database. It also would need to show when the trains are due to arrive next, and calculate the number of minutes until arrival. 

### Tools/Technologies Used
I continued to use HTML5, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and Bootstrap 4 with this assignment. The new technologies were Google's Firebase and Moment.js. Firebase was used to store the train objects. Firebase has some interesting features that make it great for small projects. They make it really easy to quickly set up a database, update the DOM with database information, and set up user Authentication. 
Moment.js is a fantastic library used for date calculations. Doing the lord's work, those guys.

### Development Notes
With this assignment, I tried to push what I could do with Javascript and JSON objects. At times, it caused me to run into pitfalls, but I think it helped me understand their utility a little more. 

### Next Steps
If I return to this project, I will try to implement user authenticaion through Firebase. I would also like to dynamically sort the trains on the schedule based on what should be arriving next. I would also like to change the color of the table row when the train is less than x number of minutes away.
